Hello world!Here are some briefly description and examples about my work. 

## Develop Testing Engineer (2012 Lab) Intern at **Huawei**
This Summer, I worked as Develop Testing Engineer at Huawei. Our team's goal is a free and **open-source** software library named "MindSpore", which used for machine learning applications such as picture recognition.I Designed test cases and exception cases for multiple operators. Connected Add, Cast and Sqrt Aicpu operators in series and parallel and set up a test environment (Ubuntu and Euler OS). After finding bugs, I debuged it with develope team member. Because my team used methodologies based on agile development. I would make a group with another develop team member and slove this problem together.

## Library System
Random Library is an old library with a very small budget that still keeps track of inventory information on paper. Its Patrons have decreased because of the difficulty to search for their desired library items. In addition, the employees are frustrated with the current system as well because it is equally difficult to update the information about existing items, add records for new books and other materials acquired through donations, and remove the records of items that are long gone. Random Library is having a hard time to maintain its current system due to its inefficiency.
Built Database Connection in **Java FX** with **MySQL** by using **JDBC** and implement a GUI with **Java FX**.
