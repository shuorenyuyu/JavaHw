# My_Work
Hello world!Here are some briefly description and examples about my work. 

## Develop Testing Engineer (2012 Lab) Intern at Huawei
This Summer, I worked as Develop Testing Engineer at Huawei. Our team's goal is a free and open-source software library named 
"MindSpore", which used for machine learning applications such as picture recognition.I Designed test cases and exception 
cases for multiple operators. Connected Add, Cast and Sqrt Aicpu operators in series and parallel and set up a test environment
(Ubuntu and Euler OS). After finding bugs, I debuged it with develope team member. Because my team used methodologies based on
agile development. I would make a group with another develop team member and slove this problem together.
